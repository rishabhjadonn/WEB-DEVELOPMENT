   <p><font size="4"><i><mark>Web development</mark> is the process of building and maintaining websites, web applications, and mobile applications using various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. It involves a range of tasks, from designing the user interface and user experience to writing code, testing, and deploying the final product.</p>
   <p>Web development is a multifaceted discipline at the heart of the digital era, encompassing the creation, design, and maintenance of websites and web applications. It intertwines various technologies and methodologies to deliver seamless user experiences across a plethora of devices and browsers. At its core lies HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which provides the structure and content of web pages, defining elements ranging from text and images to forms and multimedia. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) complements HTML by styling these elements, shaping their appearance, layout, and responsiveness, ensuring a visually compelling presentation. JavaScript, the quintessential scripting language of the web, adds dynamism and interactivity, empowering developers to craft engaging interfaces, perform client-side validations, and manipulate content in real-time.Frontend development focuses on the user-facing aspects of web applications, leveraging frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js to build modular, reusable components and manage application state efficiently. </br>Conversely, backend development revolves around server-side operations, handling data storage, retrieval, and processing, often utilizing frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, and Node.js to streamline development and ensure scalability. Database technologies such as MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL serve as the backbone of web applications, enabling persistent data storage and retrieval.</i> </p></br><hr>
